will not help.  This module defines a function that solves this problem.
emacspeak-fix-commands-that-use-interactive needs to be called To speech
enable such functions.

12.90 emacspeak-gridtext
========================

Emacspeak’s table browsing mode allows one to efficiently access content
that is tabular in nature.  That module also provides functions for
inferring table structure where possible.  Often, such structure is hard
to infer automatically –but might be known to the user e.g.  treat
columns 1 through 30 as one column of a table and so on.  This module
allows the user to specify a conceptual grid that is "overlaid" on the
region of text to turn it into a table for tabular browsing.  For now,
elements of the grid are "one line" high –but that may change in the
future if necessary.  This module is useful for browsing structured text
files and the output from programs that tabulate their output.  It’s
also useful for handling multicolumn text.  The "grid" is specified as a
list of (start end) tuples..

12.104 emacspeak-ispell
=======================

This module speech enables ispell.  Implementation note: This is hard
because of how ispell.el is written Namely, all of the work is done by
one huge hairy function.  This makes advising it hard.  The ispell
commands work well with Emacspeak as long as the list of correction
choices are few.  For interactively moving through corrections, install
package flyspell-correct from MELPA (package-install "flyspell-correct")
Then use M-x flyspell-mode.  Package flyspell is speech-enabled by
Emacspeak module emacspeak-flyspell And that module sets up
flyspell-correct to use IDO-style completion, i.e.  you can move through
corrections with C-r and C-s.

12.132 emacspeak-ocr
====================

This module defines Emacspeak front-end to OCR. This module assumes that
sane is installed and working for image acquisition, and that there is
an OCR engine that can take acquired images and produce text.

12.132.1 Emacspeak-Ocr Commands
-------------------------------

12.132.1.1 emacspeak-ocr
........................

 -- Command: emacspeak-ocr
     ‘C-e C-o’
     ‘<fn> C-o’

     An OCR front-end for the Emacspeak desktop.

     Page image is acquired using tools from the SANE package.
     The acquired image is run through the OCR engine if one is
     available, and the results placed in a buffer that is
     suitable for browsing the results.

     For detailed help, invoke command emacspeak-ocr bound to
     C-e C-o to launch emacspeak-ocr-mode, and press
     ‘?’ to display mode-specific help for emacspeak-ocr-mode.

12.132.1.2 emacspeak-ocr-backward-page
......................................

 -- Command: emacspeak-ocr-backward-page (&optional count-ignored)

     Like backward page, but tracks page number of current document.

     (fn &optional COUNT-IGNORED)

12.132.1.3 emacspeak-ocr-customize
..................................

 -- Command: emacspeak-ocr-customize

     Customize OCR settings.

12.132.1.4 emacspeak-ocr-flipflop-and-recognize-image
.....................................................

 -- Command: emacspeak-ocr-flipflop-and-recognize-image

     Run OCR engine on current image after flip-flopping it.
     Useful if you’ve scanned a page upside down and are using an engine that does not automatically flip the image for you.
     You need the imagemagik family of tools — we use mogrify to transform the image.
     Prompts for image file if file corresponding to the expected
     ‘current page’ is not found.

12.132.1.5 emacspeak-ocr-forward-page
.....................................

 -- Command: emacspeak-ocr-forward-page (&optional count-ignored)

     Like forward page, but tracks page number of current document.

     (fn &optional COUNT-IGNORED)

12.132.1.6 emacspeak-ocr-mode
.............................

 -- Command: emacspeak-ocr-mode

      An OCR front-end for the Emacspeak desktop.

     Pre-requisites:

     1) A working scanner back-end like SANE on Linux.

     2) An OCR engine.

     1: Make sure your scanner back-end works, and that you have
     the utilities to scan a document and acquire an image as a
     tiff file.  Then set variable
     emacspeak-ocr-scan-image-program to point at this utility.
     By default, this is set to ‘scanimage’ which is the image
     scanning utility provided by SANE.

     By default, this front-end attempts to compress the acquired
     tiff image; make sure you have a utility like tiffcp.
     Variable emacspeak-ocr-compress-image is set to ‘tiffcp’ by
     default; if you use something else, you should customize
     this variable.

     2: Next, make sure you have an OCR engine installed and
     working.  By default this front-end assumes that OCR is
     available as /usr/bin/ocr.

     Once you have ensured that acquiring an image and applying
     OCR to it work independently of Emacs, you can use this
     Emacspeak front-end to enable easy OCR access from within
     Emacspeak.

     The Emacspeak OCR front-end is launched by command
     emacspeak-ocr bound to C-e C-o.

     This command switches to a special buffer that has OCR
     commands bounds to single keystrokes– see the key-binding
     list at the end of this description.  Use Emacs online help
     facility to look up help on these commands.

     emacspeak-ocr-mode provides the necessary functionality to
     scan, OCR, read and save documents.  By default, scanned
     images and the resulting text are saved under directory
     ~/ocr; see variable emacspeak-ocr-working-directory.
     Invoking command emacspeak-ocr-open-working-directory bound
     to M-x emacspeak-ocr-open-working-directory will open this directory.

     By default, the document being scanned is named ‘untitled’.
     You can name the document by using command
     emacspeak-ocr-name-document bound to
     M-x emacspeak-ocr-name-document.  The document name is used
     in constructing the name of the image and text files.

     Key Bindings:

     See key             binding
     —             ——-

     RET		emacspeak-ocr-scan-and-recognize
     SPC		emacspeak-ocr-read-current-page
     1 .. 9		emacspeak-ocr-page
     ?		describe-mode
     C		emacspeak-ocr-set-compress-image-options
     I		emacspeak-ocr-set-scan-image-options
     [		emacspeak-ocr-backward-page
     ]		emacspeak-ocr-forward-page
     c		emacspeak-ocr-customize
     d		emacspeak-ocr-open-working-directory
     f		emacspeak-ocr-flipflop-and-recognize-image
     i		emacspeak-ocr-scan-image
     j		emacspeak-ocr-scan-photo
     n		emacspeak-ocr-name-document
     o		emacspeak-ocr-recognize-image
     p		emacspeak-ocr-page
     q		bury-buffer
     s		emacspeak-ocr-save-current-page
     w		emacspeak-ocr-write-document

     .

     In addition to any hooks its parent mode ‘text-mode’ might have run,
     this mode runs the hook ‘emacspeak-ocr-mode-hook’, as the final or penultimate step
     during initialization.

12.132.1.7 emacspeak-ocr-name-document
......................................

 -- Command: emacspeak-ocr-name-document (name)

12.145 emacspeak-pronounce
==========================

This module implements user customizable pronunciation dictionaries for
emacspeak.  Custom pronunciations can be defined per file, per directory
and/or per major mode.  Emacspeak maintains a persistent user dictionary
upon request and loads these in new emacspeak sessions.  This module
implements the user interface to the custom dictionary as well as
providing the internal API used by the rest of emacspeak in using the
dictionary.  Algorithm:

   The persistent dictionary is a hash table where the hash keys are
filenames, directory names, or major-mode names.  The hash values are
association lists defining the dictionary.  Users of this module can
retrieve a dictionary made up of all applicable association lists for a
given file.

     Pronunciations can be defined on a per file, per directory and/or
     per mode basis.  Pronunciations are activated on a per buffer
     basis.  Turning on the use of pronunciation dictionaries results
     in emacspeak composing a pronunciation table based on the
     currently defined pronunciation dictionaries.  After this, the
     pronunciations will be applied whenever text in the buffer is
     spoken.  Optional argument state can be used from Lisp programs

12.181.1.12 emacspeak-table-mode
................................

 -- Command: emacspeak-table-mode

     Major mode for browsing tables.
     Table mode is designed to allow speech users to browse tabular data
     with full contextual feedback while retaining all the power of the
     two-dimensional spatial layout of tables.

     In table mode, the arrow keys move between cells of the table.
     Emacspeak speaks the cell contents in a user-customizable way.  The
     visual display is kept in sync with the speech you hear; however
     Emacspeak is examining the entire table in order to speak the current
     cell content intelligently.

     You can interactively specify that emacspeak should speak either the row or
     column header (or both) while speaking each cell.  You can also specify a row
     or column filter that should be applied when speaking entire rows or columns
     –this lets you view slices of a table.  You can move to a specific row or
     column by searching the cell contents or by searching the row or column
     headers to locate items of interest.

     Here is a short description of the special commands provided in this mode.

     The next four commands help you move to the edges of the table:

     E               emacspeak-table-goto-right
     A               emacspeak-table-goto-left
     B               emacspeak-table-goto-bottom
     T               emacspeak-table-goto-top

     The next two commands let you search the table.
     The commands ask you if you want to search rows or columns.
     When searching headers remember that row 0 is the column header, and that column 0 is the row header.

     h               emacspeak-table-search-headers
     s               emacspeak-table-search

     The next command lets you specify how cell contents should be spoken.  Specify
     one of: ‘b’ for both, ‘c’ for column, ‘r’ for row, ‘f’ for row filtering and
     ‘g’ for column filtering. –table cells with then be spoken with both (or
     either)row and column headers, or with the filter applied.

     a               emacspeak-table-select-automatic-speaking-method

     The next set of commands speak the current table cell:

     .               emacspeak-table-speak-coordinates
     b               emacspeak-table-speak-both-headers-and-element
     SPC             emacspeak-table-speak-current-element
     c               emacspeak-table-speak-column-header-and-element
     r               e macspeak-table-speak-row-header-and-element

     The next set of commands navigate the table:

     right               emacspeak-table-next-column
     left               emacspeak-table-previous-column
     down               emacspeak-table-next-row
     up               emacspeak-table-previous-row
     j               emacspeak-table-goto
     S-tab               emacspeak-table-previous-column
     TAB               emacspeak-table-next-column

     Row and Column Filtering

     Filtering is designed to let you view slices of a table.
     They are specified as lists of numbers and strings.
     The concept is best explained with an example.

     A row filter specifies which of the entries in the current row should be
     spoken.Entries are numbered starting with 0.  Thus, when working with a table
     having 8 columns, a row filter of (1 2 3) will speak only entries 1 2 and 3.
     Use the sample tables in etc/tables   to familiarize yourself with this
     feature. Note that you can intersperse meaningful strings in the list that
     specifies the filter.
