12.75 emacspeak-filtertext
==========================

It is often useful to view the results of filtering large amounts of
text.;;; Typically you do this with various combinations of grep and
friends.  When doing so it requires explicit effort to not destroy the
original text being filtered.  This module provides a textfilter utility
that: A) Copies over the selected text to a special filtertext buffer B)
Implements a filtertext mode for that buffer that allows easy
application of filters C: Provides commands for reverting to the
original unfiltered text D: Provides commands for saving results from
intermediate filters.

     In addition to any hooks its parent mode ‘text-mode’ might have run,
     this mode runs the hook ‘emacspeak-filtertext-mode-hook’, as the final or penultimate step
     during initialization.

12.75.1.3 emacspeak-filtertext-revert

12.76 emacspeak-fix-interactive
===============================

Emacs commands that use the ’interactive spec to read interactive
arguments are a problem for Emacspeak.  This is because the prompting
for the arguments is done from C See (callint.c) in the Emacs sources.
Advising the various input functions, e.g.  read-file-name therefore
will not help.  This module defines a function that solves this problem.
emacspeak-fix-commands-that-use-interactive needs to be called To speech
enable such functions.

12.90 emacspeak-gridtext
========================

Emacspeak’s table browsing mode allows one to efficiently access content
that is tabular in nature.  That module also provides functions for
inferring table structure where possible.  Often, such structure is hard
to infer automatically –but might be known to the user e.g.  treat
columns 1 through 30 as one column of a table and so on.  This module
allows the user to specify a conceptual grid that is "overlaid" on the
region of text to turn it into a table for tabular browsing.  For now,
elements of the grid are "one line" high –but that may change in the
future if necessary.  This module is useful for browsing structured text
files and the output from programs that tabulate their output.  It’s
also useful for handling multicolumn text.  The "grid" is specified as a
list of (start end) tuples..

12.94 emacspeak-hide
====================

Flexible hide and show for emacspeak.  This module allows one to easily
hide or expose blocks of lines starting with a common prefix.  It is
motivated by the need to flexibly hide quoted text in email but is
designed to be more general.  the prefix parsing is inspired by
filladapt.el

12.94.1 Emacspeak-Hide Commands
-------------------------------

12.94.1.1 emacspeak-hide-or-expose-all-blocks
.............................................

 -- Command: emacspeak-hide-or-expose-all-blocks

     Hide or expose all blocks in buffer.

12.94.1.2 emacspeak-hide-or-expose-block
........................................

 -- Command: emacspeak-hide-or-expose-block (&optional prefix)
     ‘C-e j’
     ‘<fn> j’

     Hide or expose a block of text.
     This command either hides or exposes a block of text
     starting on the current line.  A block of text is defined as
     a portion of the buffer in which all lines start with a
     common PREFIX.  Optional interactive prefix arg causes all
     blocks in current buffer to be hidden or exposed.

     (fn &optional PREFIX)

12.94.1.3 emacspeak-hide-speak-block-sans-prefix
................................................

 -- Command: emacspeak-hide-speak-block-sans-prefix
     ‘C-e C-j’
     ‘<fn> C-j’

     Speaks current block after stripping its prefix.
     If the current block is not hidden, it first hides it.
     This is useful because as you locate blocks, you can invoke this
     command to listen to the block,
     and when you have heard enough navigate easily  to move past the block.

12.103 emacspeak-ispell
=======================

This module speech enables ispell.  Implementation note: This is hard
because of how ispell.el is written Namely, all of the work is done by
one huge hairy function.  This makes advising it hard.  The ispell
commands work well with Emacspeak as long as the list of correction
choices are few.  For interactively moving through corrections, install
package flyspell-correct from MELPA (package-install "flyspell-correct")
Then use M-x flyspell-mode.  Package flyspell is speech-enabled by
Emacspeak module emacspeak-flyspell And that module sets up
flyspell-correct to use IDO-style completion, i.e.  you can move through
corrections with C-r and C-s.

12.103.1 emacspeak-ispell Options
---------------------------------

 -- Variable: User Option emacspeak-ispell-max-choices

12.111 emacspeak-lispy
======================

LISPY == smart Navigation Of Lisp code This module speech-enables lispy.

12.111.1 Overview
-----------------

Lispy editing keeps delimiters balanced and Lispy navigators reliably
place point on either the opening or closing delimiter of the current
s-expression.  Emacspeak leverages this fact in the type of spoken
feedback that is produced.  All navigation commands produce the
following:
   • Speak the current s-expression when at the front of a sexp.
   • Speak the current line with option ‘emacspeak-show-point’ turned on
     when at the end of an s-expression.
   • Produce auditory icon ‘left’ or ‘right’ to indicate point being at
     the beginning or end of current line.
   • Indicate with an auditory icon if point did not move.

12.113 emacspeak-m-player
=========================

Defines an Emacspeak front-end for interacting with ‘mplayer’.  Program
‘mplayer’ is a versatile media player capable of playing many streaming
media formats.  This module provides complete access to all ‘mplayer’
functionality from a convenient Emacs interface.

12.113.1 Usage
--------------

The main entry-point is command ‘emacspeak-multimedia’ bound to ‘C-e ;’.
This prompts for and launches the desired media stream.  Once a stream
is playing, you can control it with single-letter keystrokes in the
‘*M-Player*’ buffer.  Alternatively, you can switch away from that
buffer to do real work, And invoke ‘m-player’ commands by first pressing
‘C-e ;’.  As an example, pressing ‘v’ in the ‘*M-Player*’ buffer prompts
for and sets the volume; When not in the ‘*M-Player*’ buffer, you can
achieve the same by pressing ‘C-e ; v’.  Press ‘C-h b’ in the
‘*M-Player*’ buffer to list ‘m-player’ keybindings.

12.118 emacspeak-maths
======================

12.118.1 Setup
--------------

Do not try what follows until you have read js/node/README.org and
successfully set up nvm (Node Version Manager) as described there.

12.118.2 Technical Overview
---------------------------

Spoken mathematics on the emacspeak audio desktop.  Use a NodeJS based
speech-rule-engine for Mathematics as the backend for processing
mathematical markup.  The result of this processing is an annotated
S-expression that is rendered via Emacspeak’s speech facilities.
Annotations follow Aural CSS as implemented in Emacspeak, This allows us
to map these expressions to aural properties supported by specific TTS
engines.

12.118.3 Basic Usage:
---------------------

Start the server/client: M-x emacspeak-maths-start.  Once the server and
client are started, you can browse any number of math expressions using
the emacspeak-maths-navigator described below.  Note: In general, once
everything is configured correctly, using the maths navigator
automatically starts the server and client.  Invoke the Navigator using
s-spc — this is the <windows> key on Linux.  Now you can use these keys:
   • Show Output <o> Switch to output buffer and quit Maths Navigator
   • Enter: <SPC> Enter a LaTeX expression.
   • Smart-Enter: <enter> Enter the guessed expression with no
     prompting.
   • Alt-Text <a> Process alt-text under point as LaTeX.
   • Down <down> Move down a level.
   • Up <up> Move up a level.
   • Left <left> Move left.
   • Right <right> Move right.
   • Exit <any other key> Exit navigator.

   The current expression is spoken after each of the above commands.
It is also displayed in a special buffer *Spoken Math*.  That buffer
holds all previously generated output, And Emacs commands forward-page
and backward-page can be used to move through each chunk of output.

12.122 emacspeak-mines
======================

MINES == Minesweeper game in emacs.  The game itself provides a fully
keyboard driven interface.  In addition, Emacspeak provides these
additional interactive commands:
   • ‘SPC’ Speak current cell.
   • ‘.’ Speak neighbors of current cell.
   • ‘,’ Speak number of marks
   • ‘a’ Move to beginning of row.
   • ‘e’ Move to end of row.
   • ‘g’ Move to specified cell
   • ‘s’ Move to next uncovered cell.
   • ‘/’ Speak number of remaining uncovered cells.
   • ‘'’ Speaks entire board.

   Speaking cell neighbors uses appropriate clause boundaries to group
related cells — neighbors are read left-to-right, top-to-bottom.  Moving
to the left/right edge of the board produces an appropriate auditory
icon.

========================

MUGGLES == Emacspeak spells for power-users.  This module implements no
new functionality — contrast with emacspeak-wizards.  Instead, it uses
package hydra to provide convenience key-bindings that access existing
Emacspeak functionality.  You need to install package Hydra first: ‘M-x
package-install hydra’.

   Note that on newer versions of Emacs, loading this module will
attempt to automatically install package hydra if it is not found.

12.124.1 Using Hydras
---------------------

See the high-level documentation for the Hydra package by executing ‘C-h
C-j ’ hydra ‘RET’.  The documentation in this section uses the same
terminology as shown in the hydra package documentation.

12.124.2 Implemented Muggles
----------------------------

   • Brightness: ‘print’ Control display brightness using xbacklight.
   • Navigate: ‘s-n’ Navigate with ease.
   • org-mode structure nav: ‘C-c C-SPC’ Structure navigation for
     org-mode.
   • org-mode tables: ‘C-c t’ Table UI for org-mode tables.
   • hideshow: C-, h Provide HideShow bindings.
   • toggle-option: ‘C-c o’ Single binding for toggling options.
   • Repeatable-Yank: ‘C-y’ Smart yank
   • Vuiet Explorer: ‘C-; v’ Vuiet Music Explorer and Player
   • undo-only/undo-redo: ‘C-/ ’ Undo-only on ‘/’ and undo-redo on ‘\’
   • emacspeak-maths ‘s-SPC’ Speak and browse math.

   Emacspeak automatically speaks Hydra hints when displayed.  To
silence all Hydra hints, set hydra-is-helpful to nil.  To temporarily
silence speaking of Hydra hints, Muggles can bind command
‘emacspeak-hydra-toggle-talkative’.  As an example, Muggle ‘ViewMode’
binds ‘s’ to this command.

12.131 emacspeak-ocr
====================

This module defines Emacspeak front-end to OCR. This module assumes that
sane is installed and working for image acquisition, and that there is
an OCR engine that can take acquired images and produce text.
Prerequisites: Sane installed and working.  scanimage to generate tiff
files from scanner.  tiffcp to compress the tiff file.  working ocr
executable by default this module assumes that the OCR executable is
named "ocr"

12.131.1 Emacspeak-Ocr Commands
-------------------------------

12.131.1.1 emacspeak-ocr
........................

 -- Command: emacspeak-ocr
     ‘C-e C-o’
     ‘<fn> C-o’

     An OCR front-end for the Emacspeak desktop.

     Page image is acquired using tools from the SANE package.
     The acquired image is run through the OCR engine if one is
     available, and the results placed in a buffer that is
     suitable for browsing the results.

     For detailed help, invoke command emacspeak-ocr bound to
     C-e C-o to launch emacspeak-ocr-mode, and press
     ‘?’ to display mode-specific help for emacspeak-ocr-mode.

12.131.1.2 emacspeak-ocr-backward-page
......................................

 -- Command: emacspeak-ocr-backward-page (&optional count-ignored)

     Like backward page, but tracks page number of current document.

     (fn &optional COUNT-IGNORED)

12.131.1.3 emacspeak-ocr-customize
..................................

 -- Command: emacspeak-ocr-customize

     Customize OCR settings.

12.131.1.4 emacspeak-ocr-flipflop-and-recognize-image
.....................................................

 -- Command: emacspeak-ocr-flipflop-and-recognize-image

     Run OCR engine on current image after flip-flopping it.
     Useful if you’ve scanned a page upside down and are using an engine that does not automatically flip the image for you.
     You need the imagemagik family of tools — we use mogrify to transform the image.
     Prompts for image file if file corresponding to the expected
     ‘current page’ is not found.

12.131.1.5 emacspeak-ocr-forward-page
.....................................

 -- Command: emacspeak-ocr-forward-page (&optional count-ignored)

     Like forward page, but tracks page number of current document.

     (fn &optional COUNT-IGNORED)

12.131.1.6 emacspeak-ocr-mode
.............................

 -- Command: emacspeak-ocr-mode

      An OCR front-end for the Emacspeak desktop.

     Pre-requisites:

     1) A working scanner back-end like SANE on Linux.

     2) An OCR engine.

     1: Make sure your scanner back-end works, and that you have
     the utilities to scan a document and acquire an image as a
     tiff file.  Then set variable
     emacspeak-ocr-scan-image-program to point at this utility.
     By default, this is set to ‘scanimage’ which is the image
     scanning utility provided by SANE.

     By default, this front-end attempts to compress the acquired
     tiff image; make sure you have a utility like tiffcp.
     Variable emacspeak-ocr-compress-image is set to ‘tiffcp’ by
     default; if you use something else, you should customize
     this variable.

     2: Next, make sure you have an OCR engine installed and
     working.  By default this front-end assumes that OCR is
     available as /usr/bin/ocr.

     Once you have ensured that acquiring an image and applying
     OCR to it work independently of Emacs, you can use this
     Emacspeak front-end to enable easy OCR access from within
     Emacspeak.

     The Emacspeak OCR front-end is launched by command
     emacspeak-ocr bound to C-e C-o.

     This command switches to a special buffer that has OCR
     commands bounds to single keystrokes– see the key-binding
     list at the end of this description.  Use Emacs online help
     facility to look up help on these commands.

     emacspeak-ocr-mode provides the necessary functionality to
     scan, OCR, read and save documents.  By default, scanned
     images and the resulting text are saved under directory
     ~/ocr; see variable emacspeak-ocr-working-directory.
     Invoking command emacspeak-ocr-open-working-directory bound
     to M-x emacspeak-ocr-open-working-directory will open this directory.

     By default, the document being scanned is named ‘untitled’.
     You can name the document by using command
     emacspeak-ocr-name-document bound to
     M-x emacspeak-ocr-name-document.  The document name is used
     in constructing the name of the image and text files.

     Key Bindings:

     See key             binding
     —             ——-

     RET		emacspeak-ocr-scan-and-recognize
     SPC		emacspeak-ocr-read-current-page

12.139 emacspeak-personality
============================

Implementation Notes From 2018: After 3 years, variable
emacspeak-personality-voiceify-faces has been removed, and the advice on
put-text-property and friends removed.  This module nowlimits itself to
mapping face/font-lock properties from overlays to the associated
text-property (personality).  This mapping is done via
emacspeak-personality-add.  The options for cumulative personalities
have been removed.

   Implementation Notes From 2015:

   Setting emacspeak-personality-voiceify-faces to nil now results in
dtk-speak falling back to the face->voice mapping defined via
voice-setup for the face at point.  What this means:

   1.  You always get voice-locking except when you set voice-lock-mode
to nil.

   2.  The advice on put-text-property and friends become a no-op and we
still get voice-locking.

   3.  Eventually this will become the default behavior for
voice-locking.

   Implementation Notes from 2002.

   This module defines a personality interface for implementing voice
lock via font lock.

=========================

12.140.1 PIANOBAR == Pandora Client for Emacs
---------------------------------------------

pianobar git://github.com/PromyLOPh/pianobar.git Ubuntu/Debian: sudo
apt-get install pianobar

   Pianobar Is a stand-alone client for Pandora Radio.  pianobar.el
available on the Emacs Wiki at
http://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/pianobar.el Provides access to Pandora
Radio via pianobar from the comfort of Emacs.  This module
speech-enables Pianobar and enhances it for the Complete Audio Desktop.

12.140.2 Emacspeak Usage:
-------------------------

Emacspeak implements command emacspeak-pianobar, a light-weight wrapper
on top of pianobar.  Emacspeak binds this command to ‘C-e '’.  Command
emacspeak-pianobar is designed to let you launch Pandora channels and
switch tracks/channels without moving away from your primary tasks such
as editting code or reading/composing email.  Toward this end, launching
command emacspeak-pianobar the first time initializes the ‘*pianobar*’
buffer and launches command ‘pianobar’; but focus remains in your
current buffer.  Pianobar can be controlled with single keystrokes while
in the pianobar buffer — switch to using ‘C-e ''’.  The most useful keys
are ‘right’ for skipping tracks, ‘up’ and ‘down’ for switching channels
etc.; see the keys bound in ‘pianobar-key-map’ for a complete list.
Pressing ‘C-e '’ in the ‘*pianobar*’ buffer buries the ‘*pianobar*’.
From here on, Pianobar can be controlled by pressing the Pianobar prefix
key (‘C-e '’) followed by keys from ‘pianobar-key-map’.

12.145 emacspeak-pronounce
==========================

This module implements user customizable pronunciation dictionaries for
emacspeak.  Custom pronunciations can be defined per file, per directory
and/or per major mode.  Emacspeak maintains a persistent user dictionary
upon request and loads these in new emacspeak sessions.  This module
implements the user interface to the custom dictionary as well as
providing the internal API used by the rest of emacspeak in using the
dictionary.  Algorithm:

   The persistent dictionary is a hash table where the hash keys are
filenames, directory names, or major-mode names.  The hash values are
association lists defining the dictionary.  Users of this module can
retrieve a dictionary made up of all applicable association lists for a
given file.

12.172 emacspeak-sounds
=======================

This module provides the interface for generating auditory icons in
emacspeak.  Design goal: 1) Auditory icons should be used to provide
additional feedback, not as a gimmick.  2) The interface should be
usable at all times without the icons: e.g.  when on a machine without a
sound card.  3) General principle for when to use an icon: Convey
information about events taking place in parallel.  For instance, if
making a selection automatically moves the current focus to the next
choice, We speak the next choice, while indicating the fact that
something was selected with a sound cue.  This interface will assume the
availability of a shell command "play" that can take one or more sound
files and play them.  This module will also provide a mapping between
names in the elisp world and actual sound files.  Modules that wish to
use auditory icons should use these names, instead of actual file names.
As of Emacspeak 13.0, this module defines a themes architecture for
auditory icons.  Sound files corresponding to a given theme are found in
appropriate subdirectories of emacspeak-sounds-directory
