Files:

raw.xml was pulled using 

wget -O raw.xml 'http://emacspeak.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default?max-results=10'
to get most recent 10 articles.

file full.xml is being hand-constructed by appending missing past articles by hand, those retrieved from previous git snapshots of emacspeak.
Going forward:

  1. Pull as many articles as needed from raw.xml using wget.
  2. Pick up newer <entry> elements from raw.xml and add to the front
     of full.xml
  3. Generate articles.html
