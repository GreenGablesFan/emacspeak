  <h3 class="section">6.3 Reading Without Moving The Cursor.</h3>
  <p>Emacspeak speaks information as you move around within a
  buffer. How much text is spoken depends on how you move, thus,
  when you move by words, you hear the current word; when you move
  by paragraphs, you hear the current paragraph spoken. In
  addition, the following commands allow you to listen to
  information without moving point (point is emacs terminology for
  the editing cursor).</p>
  <p>Reading without moving point:</p>

      <p>emacspeak-speak-char Speak character under point.

      <p>emacspeak-speak-word Speak current word. With prefix ARG,
      speaks the rest of the word from point. Negative prefix arg
      speaks from start of word to point. If executed on the same
      buffer position a second time, the word is spelled instead of
      being spoken.</p><span id=

      <p>emacspeak-speak-line Speaks current line. With prefix ARG,
      speaks the rest of the line from point. Negative prefix
      optional arg speaks from start of line to point. Voicifies if
      option ‘voice-lock-mode’ is on. Indicates indentation with a
      tone or a spoken cue if audio indentation is in use.
      Indicates position of point with an aural highlight if option
      ‘emacspeak-show-point’ is turned on — see command
      <code>emacspeak-show-point</code> bound to <kbd>C-e
      C-d</kbd>. Lines that start hidden blocks of text, e.g.
      outline header lines, or header lines of blocks created by
      command ‘emacspeak-hide-or-expose-block’ are indicated with
      auditory icon ellipses.</p><span id=

      <p>emacspeak-speak-paragraph Speak paragraph. With prefix
      arg, speaks rest of current paragraph. Negative prefix arg
      will read from start of current paragraph to point. If
      voice-lock-mode is on, then it will use any defined
      personality.</p><span id=

      <p>emacspeak-speak-rectangle Speak a rectangle of text.
      Rectangle is delimited by point and mark. When call from a

      <p>emacspeak-speak-buffer Speak current buffer contents. With
      prefix ARG, speaks the rest of the buffer from point.
      Negative prefix arg speaks from start of buffer to point. If
      voice lock mode is on, the paragraphs in the buffer are voice
      annotated first, see command
      ‘emacspeak-speak-voice-annotate-paragraphs’. This provides
      the auditory equivalent of <em>dropped caps</em> from visual
      typography.</p><span id=

    <dd>
      <p>emacspeak-speak-this-buffer-other-window-display Speak
      this buffer as displayed in a different frame. Emacs allows
      you to display the same buffer in multiple windows or frames.
      These different windows can display different portions of the
      buffer. This is equivalent to leaving a book open at places
      at once. This command allows you to listen to the places
      where you have left the book open. The number used to invoke
      this command specifies which of the displays you wish to
      speak. Typically you will have two or at most three such
      displays open. The current display is 0, the next is 1, and
      so on. Optional argument ARG specifies the display to
      speak.</p><span id=

      <p>emacspeak-speak-page Speak a page. With prefix ARG, speaks
      rest of current page. Negative prefix arg will read from

      is on, then it will use any defined personality.</p>

      <p>emacspeak-speak-predefined-window Speak one of the first
      10 windows on the screen. In general, you’ll never have Emacs
      split the screen into more than two or three. Argument ARG
      determines the ’other’ window to speak. Speaks entire window
      irrespective of point. Semantics of ‘other’ is the same as
