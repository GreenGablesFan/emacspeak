  <h3 class="section">15.5 Emacspeak And Software Development</h3>
  <p>Version 0.01 of Emacspeak was written using IBM Screen-Reader
  on a PC with a terminal emulator accessing a UNIX workstation.
  But in about 2 weeks, Emacspeak was already a better environment
  for developing Emacspeak in particular and software development
  in general. Here are a few highlights in 1994 that made Emacspeak
  a good software development environment, present-day users of
  Emacspeak will see that that was just scratching the surface.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Audio formatting using voice-lock to provide aural syntax
    highlighting.</li>
    <li>Succinct auditory icons to provide efficient feedback.</li>
    <li>Emacs’ ability to navigate code structurally —</li>
  </ul>
  <p>as opposed to moving around by plain-text units such as
  characters, lines and words. S-Expressions are a major win!</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Emacs’ ability to specialize behavior based on major and
    minor modes.</li>
    <li>Ability to browse program code using tags, and getting
    fluent spoken feedback.</li>
    <li>Completion <strong>everywhere</strong>.</li>
    <li>Everything is searchable — this is a huge win when you
    cannot see the screen.</li>
    <li>Interactive spell-checking using ISpell with continuous
    spoken feedback augmented by aural highlights.</li>
    <li>Running code compilation and being able to jump to errors
    with spoken feedback.</li>
    <li>Ability to move through diff chunks when working with
    source code and source control systems; refined diffs as
    provided by the <strong>ediff</strong> package when
    speech-enabled is a major productivity win.</li>
    <li>Ability to easily move between email, document authoring
    and programming — though this may appear trivial, it continues
    to be one of Emacs’ biggest wins.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Long-term Emacs users will recognize all of the above as being
  among the reasons why they do most things inside Emacs — there is
  little that is Emacspeak specific in the above list — except that
  Emacspeak was able to provide fluent, well-integrated contextual
  feedback for all of these tasks. And that was a game-changer
  given what I had had before Emacspeak. As a case in point, I did
  not dare program in Python before I speech-enabled Emacs’
  Python-Mode; the fact that white space is significant in Python
  made it difficult to program using a plain screen-reader that was
  unaware of the semantics of the underlying content being
  accessed.</p>
